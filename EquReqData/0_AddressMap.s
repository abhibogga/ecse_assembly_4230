@ storing data in program memory.
@ We will look at the program from the lectures and investigate how the compiler/assembler stores the defined data into memory.
@ Deliverable 1: Run the program.  What value is stored into R0?
@ use gdb disas to display the dissasembly and gdb x/12xw _start to display 12 words of memory.  
@ Deliverable 2: Make a table with the addresses representing 4 byte rows and provide the value at each byte.
@ Example:	00004000	87	65	43	21
@ In the example: byte 4000 contains 21, byte 4001 contains 43, byte 4002 contains 65, byte 4003 contains 87 the full word is: 0x87654321
@ The next address row would be 00004004.  Have your table count down by addresses so the top row is lowest address.
